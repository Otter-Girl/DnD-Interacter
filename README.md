# DnD-Interacter
A DMing tool for those with typing fingers and a hate of flicking through hundreds of pieces of paper.

First big OOP project aims to explore the use of classes, sub-classes and methods. End product is simply a consequence.

Original proposal:
  World and battle manager with prompts for random encounters, weather, etc.
  Attached indept state sequencer for handling charachter conditions, equipment and saves.
  Goal is to lubricate the DMing process for autistic individuals with difficulties in co-linear information processing.
  
Reduced proposal:
  Original proposal proved too large as a stepping-stone project. Current proposal is as follows:
  Lite state sequencer for characters. 
  Handles equipment management and accessing monster information for ease-of-use.
  Goal is same as beforem but on a peeled-back scale.
